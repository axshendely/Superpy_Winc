# Report

## Introduction

In this report, we will provide an overview of the functionalities and features of the script implemented in the SUPERPY class. The script offers several functions to perform various operations related to buying and selling products, generating reports, listing products, and managing time. We will highlight three key functions: buy, report, and products, discussing their functionalities and providing additional information about each function.

## Buy Function

The buy function allows users to purchase a product and update the inventory accordingly. It performs the following steps:

1. It searches for the specified product in the inventory (bought.csv) by iterating through the CSV file using the csv_reader method.
2. If the product is found, its details, including the price and expiry date, are retrieved.
3. The function generates a new product ID using the product_id method with the type_id set as 'bought'.
4. It appends the purchase details, such as the product ID, name, current date, price, and expiry, to the bought.csv file using the csv_writer method.
5. Finally, it displays a success message confirming the purchase and provides the details of the bought product.

The buy function ensures that the product is available in the inventory and handles potential errors, such as being unable to write to the CSV file or if the product is not in stock.

## Report Function

The report function generates a report based on the specified type, either "sold" or "bought." It also supports generating reports for a specific date. The function follows these steps:

1. It checks the type of report requested, i.e., "sold" or "bought."
2. If a specific date is provided, it generates a report for that date using the to_report method, passing the report type and date.
3. If no date is provided, the function generates a report for all available records of the specified type.
4. The generated report provides information such as the product ID, name, date, and price for each sold or bought item.

The report function allows users to analyze sales or purchases for a particular date or all available records. It helps in tracking product transactions and generating insights for business analysis.

## Products Function

The products function lists all the available products in the inventory. It performs the following steps:

1. It retrieves the list of products by calling the list_products method.
2. The function displays the product details, including the name, price, and quantity, in a well-formatted manner.

The products function is useful for quickly obtaining an overview of the available products in the inventory. It assists users in managing the product catalog and monitoring stock levels.
